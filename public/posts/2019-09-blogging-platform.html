<p>This is the first of a multi-post article detailing the process for setting up a Hugo-powered blog platform using AWS services and Gitlab.</p>

<p>Hugo is a static site generator written in Go - it takes content written in Markdown format and generates flat HTML which can then be served by any number of web server platforms.</p>

<p>The advantages of using a static site generator over a content management system are speed and flexibility. Flat HTML files can be delivered by a variety of servers ranging from S3 through to a fully-fledged web server like Nginx; and the lack of need for databases and interpreted platforms like PHP or Rails makes setup and configuration much less complicated.</p>

<p>This post series is a complete walkthrough of how to set up a blog using Hugo, AWS and Gitlab. You could substitute another combination of version control and continuous integration service for Gitlab, but this offers a simple CI pipeline that allows deployment in response to merging a pull request.</p>

<p>The process has a number of moving parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> to generate the site content</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com">Gitlab</a> to host the source code, and provide the CI workflow for automatic build and deployment</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">S3</a> to store and serve the site itself</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront">CloudFront</a> to front S3 to provide a CDN and serve over HTTPS</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation">CloudFormation</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">Lambda</a> to provide a workaround for a specific limitation of S3 web serving</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager">Certificate Manager</a> to create SSL certificates to enable serving the site over HTTPS</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53">Route53</a> to manage DNS</li>
</ul>

<p>This looks complicated, but the end result will be a site that can securely served, handle high traffic loads, and be updated with a pull request-based workflow.</p>

<h1 id="the-process">The process</h1>

<p>The process is broken down into 6 steps, each of which has a dedicated post. As each post gets written, you can find them from the links below.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.finleap.tech/posts/2019-09-setting-up-hugo.html">Setting up Hugo locally, and configuring it as a blogging platform</a></li>
<li>Using S3 as a web server to serve the blog&rsquo;s content</li>
<li>Setting up Gitlab so that you can use pull requests to trigger builds and deployments</li>
<li>Setting up your blog&rsquo;s domain with Route53, and using AWS to manage SSL certificates to enable serving the site over HTTPS</li>
<li>Setting up Cloudfront to act as a CDN for the blog&rsquo;s content to DDOS-proof your site</li>
<li>Using AWS Lambda and Cloudformation to rewrite URLS on the fly, working around a couple of S3-and-Hugo-created edge cases</li>
</ul>

<p>Although it might seem like a lot of steps, the end result is a workflow that will be familiar to anyone working with source code; and a blogging platform that can withstand high traffic loads at minimal cost. It&rsquo;s also a good walkthough some of the many services that AWS offers, and an introduction to some of the processes and terminology that Amazon uses.</p>
